# LifeQuest

LifeQuest is an Android app where you can complete self-defined quests in real life, level up, try not to die, and reap your own self-defined rewards.

This used to be available on the Google Play Store, but I no longer wish to maintain it as the code is now old, amateur, and unsafe (API keys have been in this repo from the beginning).
